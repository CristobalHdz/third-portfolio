# Section 02: General Information
The task is to update out career portfolio using the new tool we have learned so far.

# Section 03: My experience

The task was not so difficult to accomplish. I grabbed my last portfolio and applied materialize into it. The biggest problem was to re-apply everything from mobile into PC just becasue everything was made initially for PC.
